# Alpenglow Theme for Microsoft Visual Studio

This repository contains a `theme.json` file that can be converted to a `.vssettings` file using [Studiostyl.es](https://studiostyl.es/schemes/create) such that the Alpenglow theme can be used in Microsoft Visual Studio.

**This is still in an early stage of development**

## Installation

You can also download a pre-compiled version from the [latest release](https://github.com/AlpenglowTheme/alpenglow-visual-studio/releases/latest).
